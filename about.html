      <p>FLORYN</p>

      <p>
        Belerick stumbled upon the decline of Agelta Drylands during a meander of his many ago.
        The despair and sorrow almost consumed him, when a blooming little flower suddenly broke into his sight.
        "There's still life!" Moved by such tenacious vitality, the treant decided to create what was later known as the Oasis at the place.
        While creating the Oasis, Belerick unintentionally poured more power into the little flower, and the overflowing energy condensed into a glowing seed.
        The little flower, however, underwent an even more peculiar transition. It turned into a life form that had never appeared on the Land of Dawn Floryn.
        Since the day she was born, Floryn had never stepped out of the Oasis. The latter isolated her from the harsh environment of the desert, allowing her to live a life carefree.
        To Floryn, that glowing seed was the only mystery in her peaceful life. She spent the days contemplating the secret of the seed and the nights sleeping in the shade of the leaves.
        Only explorers and caravans would occasionally visit this undisturbed little world.Among the caravans that frequented the Oasis, Floryn met a young man with a dazzling smile.
        He'd tell Floryn fun stories he'd seen or heard on his journey whenever he came to lodge at the Oasis. As their friendship gradually deepened, Floryn's trust in the young man also grew.
        She showed the young man the glowing seed, hoping the latter could help her solve the puzzle.
        At first, the young man helped Floryn look for info about the seed wholeheartedly. As time went by, however, Floryn found the young man was always avoiding her eyes,
        and he'd change the subject whenever the seed was brought up. Floryn began to worry about the young man's state.
        One night, Floryn woke up with a start. She was shocked to find the seed she'd always carried with her had disappeared!
        Floryn searched everywhere in the Oasis but to no avail. Torn with anxiety, Floryn went to ask the young man for help, only to discover he'd already left the Oasis with his camel.
        A thought that Floryn dreaded to believe came to her mind could it be him?
        Floryn followed the young man's trail out of the Oasis. She wanted to find out the truth.
        However, what awaited her was a silent answer from what she saw and heard along the way. It was the first time Floryn had stepped into the desert, 
        and also the first time she'd seen the howling sandstorms and the look of despair on people's faces.
        Before that, she'd never understood what kind of suffering people outside the Oasis were going through.
